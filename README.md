# FA-Premier-League
Analysis of historical performance of champions during the Premier League era. First run the create_table.py file to create an SQLite database and tables where we will be writing the information from csv files. Further run the EPL.py file to read all the csv files and write the data into the database that was created eralier. Then analysis2.py file will run throught the data available in the database and provide some analysis on the parameters that I have picked to analyse. Please feel free to make any suggestions to improve the analysis or some new databasis that might actualy help to build a predictive model.
